### Word Vectors 

Probably the first task in language understanding is to represent the discrete symbolic representation into
a numerical vectors corresponding to the said symbol that captures not only syntactic structure but also the semantic meaning.

A human language is a discrete/symbolic/categorical signalling system.
The symbol is invariant across different encodings. However, a brain encoding appears to be a continuous pattern of activation, and the 
symbols are transmitted via continuous signals of sound/vision.
